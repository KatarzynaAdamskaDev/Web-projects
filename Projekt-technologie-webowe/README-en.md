# Project Description: VearMe&DressIT 
    This project was created in collaboration with Julia Fidecka as part of the Web Technologies in Business course. The website was built by combining our individual base projects, which were originally developed as seperate assignments for course credit. Together, we expanded them into a single, cohesive website with multiple sections and interactive features.

## My responsibilities in the project
    I was responsible for the following elements:

    1. Homepage:
        - Designing and coding the entire homepage excluding: the footer, navigation bar and newsletter section

    2. "Offer" section:
        - Creating the entire "Offer" subpage
        - Implementing dynamic product filters

    3. Shopping cart:
        - Writing JavaScript code to display products in the cart after they are added
        - Programming the display of the total purchase amount

    4. "About us" section: 
        - Creating the comments section
        - Adding text animations where the text appears and disappears at set intervals

    5. Page DressIT:
        - On the "Dzia≈Çanie" section, I implemented a hover effect that slightly enlarges the text boxes on mouseover and returns them to their original size when the cursor is removed
        - On the "Cennik" section, I implemented a hover effect that changes the background of the subscription plan cells to a light grey, enhancing readability and visual appeal.
